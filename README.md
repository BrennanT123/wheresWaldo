# wheresWaldo

This is a charcter finding game similar to the common childrens book "Wheres Waldo". For this game you must find 3 characters. Every wrong guess removes 50 points from your score and every second you take to find the characters removes 10 points. 

This app was built using nodejs for the backend and react for the frontend. The backend API uses a postgres database with prisma ORM. The API has routes allowing the frontend to retrieve the leaderboard, session data, scores, characters, scenes, etc...
